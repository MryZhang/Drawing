Drawing
Cat Morgan, Oct. 23, 2013, Graphics Assignment 

=============================================================

A partial drawing program, assigned in Graphics using C++

Use the left mouse to draw and the center wheel click to bring up the menu. You can draw different shapes
with different colors, and change the properties of the objects. I was unable to complete this assignment due 
to time constraints. This was the case with all the other students as well.
